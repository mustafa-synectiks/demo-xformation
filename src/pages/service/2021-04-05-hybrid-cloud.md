        ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/papu/image/upload/v1623256827/MicroServices/our_process_dttjbp.png)




        We recommend assessing the company’s applications and IT estate and creating a roadmap to guide the journey to optimal hybrid cloud. This roadmap should compare current and future run costs to create a business case for change; assess application and workload placement and data locality options; recommend application transformation requirements; consider IT policy and operating model factors; and ultimately produce clear, data-based recommendations with a proposed execution plan to enable hybrid IT transformation to happen. Getting there will require transforming and migrating applications, integrating, and orchestrating environments, automating and monitoring business services, enabling digital processes, and integrating data and security.
