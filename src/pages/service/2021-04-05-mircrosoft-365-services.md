      The internet was set on fire (pun intended) this week, by what I'm calling
      'fox gate', and chances are you might have seen a meme or two about the
      Firefox logo. Many people were pulling up for a battle royale because they
      thought we had scrubbed fox imagery from our browser. We can confirm, that
      this is definitely not happening.The post Here’s what’s happening with the
