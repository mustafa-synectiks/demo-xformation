      JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the server-side, using a runtime such as Node.js.

      JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Although "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases.

      JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.he official The internet was set on fire (pun intended) this week, by what I'm calling 'fox gate', and chances are you might have seen a meme or two about the Firefox logo.

    Microservices architecture, divides the business functionality and data that is stored horizontally into cohesive verticals by implementing a specific domain. At Synectiks, the foundation of this approach is Xformation, a multi-cloud microservices development platform. With Xformation, you can build the microservices development ecosystem and thereby adopt enterprise-wide SOA architecture quickly and gain development velocity. It is designed to help you to quickly build API-first design and establish necessary operation ecosystem.

        Two ways to extract value from legacy apps, as below: 


        Business Logic: Creating microservices that become APIs enabling business user to assemble various functionalities and truly become an API driven organization with an API centric application architecture. This allows the organization to become a low-code organization where they 'assemble apps' rather than write apps. 


        Data Lake: Extracting the data in a Data Lake and exposing that data through analytical tools.

        Our approach is to use a combination of the latest industry tools, processes, experience and best practices, and provide the best solutions to our customers. 


        The teams perform a quick requirements analysis and GAP analysis to understand the current setup and provide solutions to optimize your applications, storage, databases and overall infrastructure. The very first step, discovery and assessment will give you clear insights on the improved SLA’s and cost savings. You can make informed decisions to balance workloads and optimize resources and thereby, to create a roadmap that guides the journey to Application modernization. This roadmap should map people, process, technology change requirement, consider IT policy and operating model factors; and ultimately produce clear, data-based recommendations with a proposed execution plan to enable Application Transformation. Getting there will require significant upliftment of people skills, imparting modern tools and technologies, transforming and migrating applications, integrating and orchestrating environments, automating and monitoring business services, enabling digital processes, and integrating data and security.

        Almost like a highly efficient assembly line in a manufacturing facility, each application moves through specific steps on its way to the microservices transformation. The steps include: 


        * Discover and assess application readiness. 

        * Plan and prepare the application for the refactoring. 

        * Decide which modernization methodology is appropriate. 

        * Identify the best target platform in the cloud. 

        * Identify cloud-native services to refactor without having to rewrite the code. 

        * Identify Synectiks Foundation Microservices components for reuse 

        * Validate the entire process by POC. 

        * Plan and Execute the process with DevSecOps approach. 

        * Test and validate the application prior to deployment.
