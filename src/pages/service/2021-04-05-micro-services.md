    rapidly by using existing application blocks and automation framework. You
    would minimize your risks by investing a small time & money and continue to
    do so when you see a significant ROI. The key aspect is time. The advantage
    of making us your microservices partner is, our open-source contribution so
    that customer can use our component framework for development velocity.

      JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.he official The internet was set on fire (pun intended) this week, by what I'm calling 'fox gate', and chances are you might have seen a meme or two about the Firefox logo.

        Our approach is to use a combination of the latest industry tools, processes, experience and best practices, and provide the best solutions to our customers.


        The teams perform a quick requirements analysis and GAP analysis to understand the current setup and provide solutions to optimize your applications, storage, databases and overall infrastructure. The very first step, discovery and assessment will give you clear insights on the improved SLA’s and cost savings. You can make informed decisions to balance workloads and optimize resources and thereby, to create a roadmap that guides the journey to Application modernization. This roadmap should map people, process, technology change requirement, consider IT policy and operating model factors; and ultimately produce clear, data-based recommendations with a proposed execution plan to enable Application Transformation. Getting there will require significant upliftment of people skills, imparting modern tools and technologies, transforming and migrating applications, integrating and orchestrating environments, automating and monitoring business services, enabling digital processes, and integrating data and security.

        Almost like a highly efficient assembly line in a manufacturing facility, each application moves through specific steps on its way to the microservices transformation. The steps include:


        * Discover and assess application readiness.

        * Plan and prepare the application for the refactoring.

        * Decide which modernization methodology is appropriate.

        * Identify the best target platform in the cloud.

        * Identify cloud-native services to refactor without having to rewrite the code.

        * Identify Synectiks Foundation Microservices components for reuse Validate the entire process by POC.

        * Plan and Execute the process with DevSecOps approach.

        * Test and validate the application prior to deployment.
